1. Control Room
The billionaire, sweating in his ergonomic chair, monitored the screens showing the apocalypse outside. His head of security, a burly guy with hawk-like eyes, offered him a coffee “to calm the nerves.” Smiling like a shark, he poured in the poison synthesized in the lab: a neurotoxin that melted the brain from the inside.
As the tycoon convulsed, foaming at the mouth and screaming about betrayals, the guard hacked the central system with a playful grin. “Goodbye, boss. Your fortune is mine now,” he murmured, transferring billions to offshore accounts. Cruel reflection: in a bunker, surveillance is just an illusion until the watcher watches you.
2. Master Bedroom
Cuddled in his king-size bed with Egyptian cotton sheets, the billionaire hugged his wife, whispering promises of a post-apocalyptic future. She, with sweet eyes, prepared his sleeping pill, but this time coated it with cyanide from the emergency reserves.
His last words were a choked gurgle as his face turned blue like a forgotten emoji. The wife, laughing maliciously, accessed the secret drawer under the bed and extracted the master fortune chip. “Thanks for the kids and yachts, darling. Now everything is ours.” Fun twist: love is the sweetest poison when there’s inheritance at stake.
3. Industrial Kitchen
In the gleaming kitchen full of high-end appliances, the billionaire devoured a synthetic steak while chatting with the chef, an Italian with a twisted mustache. “This is the best bunker in the world!” he boasted, ignoring the knife the chef was sharpening discreetly.
With a magician’s move, the chef plunged the blade into his jugular, splattering blood sauce across the counter. “Mamma mia, so fresh!” he joked, emptying the hidden pantry servers and redirecting the cryptocurrencies. Hilarious reflection: in the hunger of the world’s end, the chef always eats first.
4. Private Gym
Sweating on the panoramic fake treadmill, the billionaire boasted about his physique to his personal trainer, an ex-military guy with trunk-like arms. “Keep the pace, boss!” the guy shouted, cranking the speed to maximum.
Suddenly, the machine accelerated on its own—sabotaged with a simple hack—and the billionaire tripped, snapping his neck against the weight bar. The trainer, cackling, picked up the corpse’s biometric phone and transferred everything. “Fatal workout completed.” Fun cruelty: exercise kills, but only if you pay enough.
5. Digital Library
Amid floating hologram pages, the billionaire read survival treatises with his private librarian, a bespectacled bookworm. “Wisdom will save us,” he pontificated, sipping the tea the servant handed him.
The tea contained ricin, deadly and tasteless, stopping his heart in minutes. The librarian, smiling sardonically, erased the digital wills and rewrote his own. “True wisdom is knowing when to close the book.” Reflective touch: books lie; knowledge is power for the one who steals it.
6. Cinema Room
Projecting blockbusters on a curved screen, the billionaire laughed with his teenage kids, popcorn in hand. “Dad is invincible!” he exclaimed, while one of them tinkered with the remote projector.
An “accidental” short circuit released neurotoxic gas from the ventilation system, asphyxiating him amid fictional explosions. The kids, applauding like demons, hacked his smartwatch and split the empire. “Better ending than any movie.” Imaginative and cruel: the family that laughs together, kills together.
7. Scientific Lab
In a white lab coat, the billionaire experimented with synthetic viruses alongside his star biochemist. “We’ll cure the new world!” he said, injecting himself with a falsified “longevity serum.”
The chemist had reversed the formula: a virus that liquefied internal organs. As he melted in agony, the scientist transferred patents and funds. “Experiment successful.” Fun horror: science advances by stepping on rich corpses.
8. Games Room
Playing virtual poker with his butler, the billionaire bet cryptos like chips. “Full house!” he shouted, drinking the whisky the servant poured.
The whisky had a twist: poisoned ice bullets that melted in his throat, shredding it. The butler shuffled the bank accounts and won the final hand. “I had the ace up my sleeve.” Reflective: in life’s game, the dealer always cheats.
9. Steam Room
Relaxing in the private sauna, the billionaire chatted with his Thai masseuse. “This is paradise!” he gasped, ignoring the tampered thermostat.
The temperature shot to 150°C, cooking him alive like a shrimp. She, fresh as lettuce, extracted the financial chip ring from the charred finger. “Thai sauna: hot and final.” Hilarious cruelty: steam rises, but betrayal burns hotter.
10. Armory
Inspecting laser rifles with his bodyguard, the billionaire posed like Rambo. “No one will touch us!” he bragged, testing a weapon.
The bodyguard “accidentally” fired a tracer bullet into his chest, laughing: “Missed the practice shot!” Then he emptied the financial arsenal. “Now I’m the boss.” Imaginative: weapons protect until they point inward.
11. Meditation Room
In lotus on high-tech tatami, the billionaire meditated with his personal guru. “Om, inner peace,” he murmured, inhaling the “special” incense.
The incense was laced with pure fentanyl, stopping his zen breathing. The guru, enlightened, transferred the financial karma. “Your aura is mine now.” Fun and reflective: true enlightenment is stealing in silence.
12. Kids’ Room
Playing with his grandchildren in the playroom, the billionaire told tales of riches. “Everything will be yours!” he promised, eating offered candies.
The candies had child-sized cyanide, lethal in adult doses. The kids, laughing like demons, used his fingerprint for the loot. “Grandpa was a candy!” Pure cruelty: innocence is the best disguise for murder.
13. Executive Office
Signing contracts at his holographic desk, the billionaire negotiated with his accountant. “Eternal expansion!” he said, signing with a laser pen.
The pen injected a lethal coagulant, causing a massive stroke. The accountant erased signatures and rewrote inheritances. “Final numbers: you zero, me everything.” Reflective: balances always even out with blood.
14. Power Generator Room
Inspecting the miniature nuclear reactor with his chief engineer, the billionaire boasted: “Infinite energy for my legacy!”
The engineer overloaded the panel, electrocuting him in a blue spark arc. “Energy transferred,” he said, redirecting funds to his own. Fun finale: the lights go out, but power always finds a new plug.
